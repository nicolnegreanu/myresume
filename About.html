<!-- <p>Hey, I'm Nicol...</p>

   <p> I am also fascinated about the way programming can shape the human mind and vice versa!</p>

   <p> "Declare speculations, not war!"</p> -->

 
 <p>My mood carries me like a vine, or a leaf in the wind, from low to high and from high to low, from soft to hard and vice versa. It carries me like a stork on a cabbage...</p>

<p>In the eternity of a moment, the echo of thought flashes through me,</p>

<p>Then it fades with the "axe of a paddle" of oblivion,</p>

<p>But in its wake remains the emotion of grief, of despair,</p>

<p>So that I no longer know what the starting point was...</p>

<h3>Reflection on resignation</h3>
<p>
The bittersweet taste of resignation saves me from suffering, or, more precisely, if i do not avoid suffering, i will go through it, like a goose through water, then i will see that it is good. An objective, non-relative good, which leaves no room for interpretations, contrary to when i build my happiness on the suffering of others. Resignation is composed of mercy, but, above all, it brings a lot of peace of mind, which makes it easy to bear, and in the end you even receive a reward - and what a reward: "but he who endures to the end, the same will be saved".</p>

<p>Let's say that living with resignation is similar to going through life like a duck through radioactive water...</p>
